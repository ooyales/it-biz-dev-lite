ETL PIPELINES & DASHBOARD EXPERIENCE
======================================

Our data engineering and analytics team specializes in building enterprise data
pipelines and interactive dashboards for federal agencies.

ETL PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT
We have designed and implemented ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines that
process millions of records daily across multiple federal data sources. Our approach
emphasizes data quality, lineage tracking, and automated validation.

Recent ETL projects include:
- Built an automated data pipeline that ingests financial transaction data from
  5 disparate accounting systems, applies business rule transformations, and loads
  into a centralized data warehouse. Reduced manual data reconciliation effort from
  40 hours/week to 2 hours/week.
- Developed real-time ETL pipelines using Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming to
  process cybersecurity event logs from 10,000+ endpoints, enabling sub-minute
  threat detection and automated incident creation.
- Created a data migration framework that safely transferred 50TB of legacy
  mainframe data to cloud-hosted PostgreSQL, including automated data validation
  and rollback capabilities.

ETL TECHNOLOGIES
- Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration and scheduling
- Apache Spark and PySpark for large-scale data processing
- AWS Glue and Step Functions for serverless ETL
- Python pandas for data transformation and cleaning
- dbt (data build tool) for SQL-based transformations
- Great Expectations for automated data quality validation

DASHBOARD & REPORTING SOLUTIONS
We build executive dashboards and operational reporting solutions that transform
raw federal data into actionable insights.

Dashboard projects include:
- Agency-wide performance dashboard tracking 50+ KPIs across 12 program offices,
  with drill-down capability from executive summary to individual transaction detail.
  Built with Power BI embedded in a SharePoint Online portal.
- Real-time IT infrastructure monitoring dashboard showing system health, SLA
  compliance, and capacity utilization across 500+ servers. Built with Grafana
  connected to Prometheus and CloudWatch data sources.
- Financial execution dashboard providing daily budget obligation and expenditure
  tracking with automated alerts for spending anomalies. Built with React and
  Recharts connected to a Python Flask API.
- Acquisition pipeline dashboard showing procurement lifecycle status, milestone
  tracking, and vendor performance metrics. Built with Tableau connected to a
  SQL Server data warehouse.

DASHBOARD TECHNOLOGIES
- Power BI (including Power BI Embedded and Report Server)
- Tableau Server and Tableau Public
- Custom React dashboards with D3.js, Recharts, and Chart.js
- Grafana for infrastructure and operations monitoring
- Python Plotly/Dash for data science visualizations
- Jupyter Notebooks for ad-hoc analysis and reporting

DATA GOVERNANCE & QUALITY
Our data governance practice ensures that agency data assets are properly managed,
documented, and trusted. We implement:
- Data catalogs and metadata management (Apache Atlas, Collibra)
- Data quality monitoring with automated anomaly detection
- Master data management for key entity types (vendors, employees, assets)
- Data lineage tracking from source systems through transformations to reports
- Compliance with federal data standards (NIST, OMB, CDO Council)
