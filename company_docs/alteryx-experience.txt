For a prominent multinational bank, we implemented a robust TBM data management strategy, critical for ensuring data lineage and optimizing ETL processes. We leveraged a combination of industry-leading tools, including Alteryx, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and Tableau Prep. Alteryx proved particularly adept at connecting directly to a diverse array of data warehouses, SQL databases, and various structured files, including CSV, Excel, and other delimited formats. This broad connectivity enabled seamless extraction of disparate financial data sources. Furthermore, Alteryx's intuitive visual interface facilitated efficient data blending, cleaning, reformatting, and enrichment, enabling the execution of complex cost modeling tasks, such as allocations, joins, and calculated fields, outside of the Apptio environment. This pre-processing step ensured that only "analysis-ready" data entered the development, staging, and production workspaces. The Alteryx platform’s comprehensive suite of out-of-the-box transformation tools allowed for consistent mapping of financial codes, normalization of data structures, aggregation to the appropriate granularity, and crucial validation against business rules prior to upload to the Apptio TBM Studio—effectively preventing model errors and misclassifications.
