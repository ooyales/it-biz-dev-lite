FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT & AUDIT EXPERIENCE
=========================================

Our team has extensive experience supporting federal financial management systems
and audit readiness initiatives across multiple civilian and defense agencies.

FINANCIAL SYSTEM MODERNIZATION
We led a multi-year financial system modernization effort for a major federal agency,
migrating from legacy COBOL-based accounting systems to a modern cloud-hosted ERP
platform. The project involved mapping 15+ years of financial transaction data,
implementing automated reconciliation processes, and establishing real-time financial
reporting dashboards. The new system reduced monthly close times from 15 days to 3 days
and achieved a clean audit opinion within the first year of operation.

AUDIT READINESS & COMPLIANCE
Our team has supported agencies in achieving and maintaining audit readiness under
OMB Circular A-123 and FFMIA requirements. We developed automated internal control
testing frameworks that continuously monitor transaction flows, segregation of duties,
and authorization thresholds. Our approach includes:
- Automated testing of key financial controls using data analytics
- Continuous monitoring dashboards for real-time compliance visibility
- Risk-based audit sampling methodologies
- Corrective action plan tracking and remediation support
- Training programs for financial management staff

FINANCIAL DATA ANALYTICS
We built custom financial analytics platforms that integrate data from multiple
accounting systems (SAP, Oracle Federal Financials, Momentum) into unified data
warehouses. These platforms support:
- Budget execution tracking and forecasting
- Improper payment detection using machine learning models
- Spend analysis across appropriation categories
- Vendor payment trend analysis
- Grant and cooperative agreement financial monitoring

BUDGET FORMULATION & EXECUTION
Our team supports the full budget lifecycle from formulation through execution and
reporting. We have developed budget management tools that automate OMB MAX submissions,
track obligation and expenditure rates against plans, and provide early warning
indicators for potential Anti-Deficiency Act violations. Our budget analysts have
experience with all major federal appropriation types including annual, multi-year,
and no-year funds.
