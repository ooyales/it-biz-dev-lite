COMPANY EXPERIENCE DOCUMENTS
=============================

Place .txt or .docx files in this folder describing your company's experience,
capabilities, and past performance. The RFI Generator will automatically search
these documents for relevant content when generating responses to RFI questions.

TIPS:
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., "finance-audit-experience.txt")
- Include specific details: project names, agencies, technologies used, outcomes
- One topic per file works best (e.g., separate files for finance, cloud, ETL)
- Both .txt and .docx formats are supported
- Files are searched by keyword matching against RFI questions
- The more specific your descriptions, the better the generated responses

EXAMPLE TOPICS:
- Financial management and audit experience
- Cloud migration and modernization projects
- ETL pipelines and data warehousing
- Dashboard and reporting solutions
- Cybersecurity and compliance frameworks
- Agile development methodology
- Federal contracting past performance
