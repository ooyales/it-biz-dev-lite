TECHNOLOGY & CLOUD MODERNIZATION EXPERIENCE
=============================================

Our team delivers enterprise technology solutions for federal agencies, specializing
in cloud migration, application modernization, and digital transformation initiatives.

CLOUD MIGRATION & INFRASTRUCTURE
We have successfully migrated 200+ applications to AWS GovCloud and Azure Government
environments for federal civilian and DoD agencies. Our cloud migration methodology
includes:
- Application portfolio assessment and rationalization (6 Rs framework)
- Cloud readiness scoring and migration sequencing
- Infrastructure-as-Code using Terraform and CloudFormation
- Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes (EKS/AKS)
- FedRAMP and FISMA compliance automation
- Continuous monitoring and ATO maintenance

ENTERPRISE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
Our development teams use Agile/SAFe methodologies to build modern web applications
that meet federal accessibility (Section 508) and security requirements. Recent
projects include:
- Custom case management system serving 5,000+ federal employees
- Citizen-facing portal processing 100,000+ applications annually
- Internal knowledge management platform with AI-powered search
- Mobile-responsive field inspection applications

CYBERSECURITY & COMPLIANCE
Our cybersecurity practice supports agencies in achieving and maintaining Authority
to Operate (ATO) under NIST RMF. We provide:
- Security control implementation and assessment (NIST 800-53)
- Vulnerability management and penetration testing
- Security architecture review and threat modeling
- Incident response planning and tabletop exercises
- Zero Trust Architecture implementation aligned with OMB M-22-09

API INTEGRATION & MICROSERVICES
We design and implement API-first architectures that enable interoperability across
federal systems. Our integration experience includes:
- RESTful API design following federal API standards
- Event-driven architectures using Apache Kafka and AWS SNS/SQS
- Legacy system integration via API gateways and adapters
- Data exchange with SAM.gov, USAspending, FPDS, and other federal systems
