## 🎨 How It Works

### 1. Company Profile

First, customize your company info in the script:

```python
class CompanyProfile:
    def __init__(self):
        self.company_name = "Acme Federal Solutions"  # Your company
        self.duns = "987654321"  # Your DUNS
        self.cage_code = "9Z8Y7"  # Your CAGE code
        self.socioeconomic_status = "8(a) Small Business"
        
        self.capabilities = [
            "Cloud computing and migration",
            "Cybersecurity services",
            # Add your capabilities
        ]
        
        self.past_performance = [
            {
                'project': 'Your Project Name',
                'client': 'Client Agency',
                'value': '$1.5M',
                'period': '2023-2024',
                'description': 'What you did',
                'poc': 'Name, email, phone'
            }
        ]
```

### 2. Question Extraction

Automatically finds RFI questions using patterns:

**Numbered Questions:**
```
1. What is your company's experience?
2. Describe your technical approach.
3. Provide past performance examples.
```

**Lettered Questions:**
```
A. Company background
B. Key personnel
C. Technical capabilities
```

**If no questions found:** Creates standard RFI sections

### 3. Claude AI Generation

For each question, sends a prompt to Claude:

```
You are writing an RFI response for [Opportunity].

Our Company: [Capabilities, past performance, certifications]

Question: [The RFI question]

Write a professional 2-3 paragraph response that:
- Directly answers the question
- Highlights relevant capabilities
- References specific past performance
- Uses federal contracting language
```

### 4. Document Creation

Creates professional Word document with:
- ✅ Proper formatting and headings
- ✅ Tables for company information
- ✅ Numbered sections
- ✅ Page breaks
- ✅ Professional styling

## 💡 Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Quick RFI Response

```bash
cd knowledge_graph
python3 << 'EOF'
from rfi_generator import RFIResponseGenerator

# Your opportunity from SAM.gov
opportunity = {
    'title': 'IT Support Services',
    'agency': 'VA',
    'notice_id': 'VA-RFI-2026-001',
    'description': '''
    RFI Questions:
    1. What is your experience with VA systems?
    2. Describe your technical approach.
    3. Provide three past performance references.
    '''
}

generator = RFIResponseGenerator()
filename = generator.generate_rfi_response(opportunity)
print(f"RFI saved to: {filename}")
EOF
```

### Scenario 2: Batch RFI Generation

Generate responses for multiple RFIs:

```python
from opportunity_scout import OpportunityScout
from rfi_generator import RFIResponseGenerator

scout = OpportunityScout()
generator = RFIResponseGenerator()

# Get opportunities requiring RFIs
opportunities = scout.fetch_opportunities(days_back=30)

for opp in opportunities:
    # Check if it's an RFI
    if 'RFI' in opp.get('type', '') or 'sources sought' in opp.get('title', '').lower():
        print(f"Generating RFI for: {opp['title']}")
        generator.generate_rfi_response(opp)
```

### Scenario 3: Customize Company Profile

Load your company info from database:

```python
class CompanyProfile:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load from your database/config
        with open('company_config.json') as f:
            config = json.load(f)
        
        self.company_name = config['name']
        self.duns = config['duns']
        self.capabilities = config['capabilities']
        
        # Load past performance from database
        self.past_performance = self.load_from_database()
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Add More Past Performance

```python
self.past_performance = [
    {
        'project': 'Enterprise Cloud Migration',
        'client': 'Department of Energy',
        'value': '$3.2M',
        'period': '2021-2024',
        'description': 'Migrated 50+ applications to AWS GovCloud',
        'poc': 'Jane Smith, jane.smith@doe.gov, (555) 123-4567'
    },
    # Add all your contracts
]
```

### Add Certifications

```python
self.company_certifications = [
    'ISO 9001:2015',
    'ISO 27001:2013',
    'CMMI Level 3',
    'ISO 20000-1',
    'FedRAMP Ready',
    # Your certifications
]
```

### Add Key Personnel

```python
self.key_personnel = [
    {
        'name': 'John Doe',
        'title': 'Program Manager',
        'clearance': 'Top Secret',
        'experience': '20 years federal IT',
        'certifications': ['PMP', 'ITIL']
    },
    # Your team members
]
```

## 🎯 Integration with Other Agents

### Combined with Opportunity Scout

```python
from opportunity_scout import OpportunityScout
from rfi_generator import RFIResponseGenerator

scout = OpportunityScout()
rfi_gen = RFIResponseGenerator()

# Get high-priority opportunities
opportunities = scout.fetch_opportunities(days_back=7)

for opp in opportunities:
    score = scout.score_opportunity(opp)
    
    # Generate RFI for high-priority with contacts
    if score['priority'] == 'HIGH' and score['contacts']['total_contacts'] > 0:
        if 'RFI' in opp.get('description', ''):
            print(f"Generating RFI for high-value opportunity: {opp['title']}")
            rfi_gen.generate_rfi_response(opp)
```

### Combined with Capability Matcher

```python
from capability_matcher import CapabilityMatcher
from rfi_generator import RFIResponseGenerator

cap_matcher = CapabilityMatcher()
rfi_gen = RFIResponseGenerator()

# Analyze capability first
cap_analysis = cap_matcher.analyze_opportunity(opportunity)

if cap_analysis['capability_score'] >= 70:
    # Only generate RFI if we can do the work
    print(f"Good capability match ({cap_analysis['capability_score']}/100)")
    print("Generating RFI response...")
    rfi_gen.generate_rfi_response(opportunity)
else:
    print(f"Poor capability match ({cap_analysis['capability_score']}/100)")
    print("Consider teaming before responding to RFI")
```
